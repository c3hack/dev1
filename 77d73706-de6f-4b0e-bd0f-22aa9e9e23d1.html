Use a PivotTable when you want to analyze related totals, especially when you have a long list of figures to sum and you want to compare several facts about each figure. Because a PivotTable is interactive, you can freely experiment with layout of the data to focus on specific details or calculate different summaries, such as counts or averages.</p>

<h2 data-ddue="section">When to use a PivotTable</h2>

<p data-ddue="para">PivotTables are especially designed for the following uses:</p>

<ul data-ddue="ddue:list">
	<li>
	<p data-ddue="para">Getting perspective on large amounts of data in multiple ways and showing how it works.&#160;</p>
	</li>

</ul>

<p data-ddue="para">Use a PivotTable when you want to analyze related totals, especially when you have a long list of figures to sum, and aggregated data or subtotals would help you look at the data from different perspectives and compare figures of similar data.</p>

<p data-ddue="para">The following example shows a worksheet with quarterly sales by state. The data is in no particular order:</p>

<p data-ddue="para"><img data-guid="786876df-64bb-4a92-b5e5-2aad6ace5e65" src="/content/images/786876df-64bb-4a92-b5e5-2aad6ace5e65" /></p>

<p data-ddue="para">The following example shows how the same data can be better summarized in a PivotTable:</p>

<p data-ddue="para"><img data-guid="45a5e50f-06d2-4120-bf21-1017e4c6d993" src="/content/images/45a5e50f-06d2-4120-bf21-1017e4c6d993" /></p>

<p data-ddue="para">In a PivotTable, each column or field in the source data becomes a <span contenteditable="false" data-ddue="token" data-token-guid="1fef6071-64d3-4826-85f5-1aa688897210" data-tokenname="TE102657349" title="Shared content. Right-click in edit mode for options.">PivotTable field</span> that summarizes multiple rows of information. In the previous example, the Location column becomes the Location field, and each record (a collection of information about a field) for California is summarized in a single <span contenteditable="false" data-ddue="token" data-token-guid="99961b45-51f7-4a3d-a9f0-78432ca3b7d6" data-tokenname="TE102657352" title="Shared content. Right-click in edit mode for options.">PivotTable item</span> for California.</p>

<p data-ddue="para">A value field, such as Sum of Sales, contains the values to be summarized. In the previous report, the Q3 California summary contains the sum of the Sales value from every row in the worksheet for which the Location column contains California and the Quarter column contains Q3.</p>

<h2 data-ddue="section">Preparing your data for a PivotTable</h2>

<p data-ddue="para">When you use a worksheet as the basis for a PivotTable, the data should be in a list or table format with descriptive column names in the first row. Each cell in later rows should contain data appropriate to its column name. There should be no blank rows or blank columns within the data of interest. Excel uses your column names as field names in PivotTables. Using the PivotTable Builder, you can drag these fields into the row, column and report filter areas of the PivotTable.</p>
