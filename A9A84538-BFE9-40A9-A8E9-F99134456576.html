<p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Being able to quickly analyze data can help you make better business decisions. But sometimes itâ€™s hard to know where to start, especially when you have a lot of data. PivotTables are a great way to summarize, analyze, explore, and present your data, and you can create them with just a few clicks. PivotTables are highly flexible and can be quickly adjusted depending on how you need to display your results. You can also create PivotCharts based on PivotTables that will automatically update when your PivotTables do.</p><p>Some of the screen shots in this article were taken in Excel 2016. If you have a different version your view might be slightly different, but unless otherwise noted, the functionality is the same.</p><p>For example, here's a simple list of household expenses, and a PivotTable based on it:</p><p><strong>Household expense data</strong></p><p><strong>Corresponding PivotTable</strong></p><figure class="image"><img src="/content/images/195a25ed-8156-4b27-bda6-ca7a367c5c28"></figure><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="/content/images/df21e682-db89-4e4c-bec1-da09e5201642"></figure><p>Next, here's a PivotChart:</p><figure class="image"><img src="/content/images/96611fdd-17b7-4cc0-851d-d06b13d1667d"></figure><h2><br>&nbsp;</h2><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Before you get started:</p><p>Your data should be organized in a tabular format, and not have any blank rows or columns. Ideally, you can use an Excel table like in our example above.</p><p>Tables are a great PivotTable data source, because rows added to a table are automatically included in the PivotTable when you refresh the data, and any new columns will be included in the PivotTable Fields List. Otherwise, you need to either manually update the data source range, or use a dynamic named range formula.</p><p>Data types in columns should be the same. For example, you shouldn't mix dates and text in the same column.</p><p>PivotTables work on a snapshot of your data, called the cache, so your actual data doesn't get altered in any way.</p><h3>Create a PivotTable</h3><p>If you have limited experience with PivotTables, or are not sure how to get started, a Recommended PivotTable is a good choice. When you use this feature, Excel determines a meaningful layout by matching the data with the most suitable areas in the PivotTable. This helps give you a starting point for additional experimentation. After a recommended PivotTable is created, you can explore different orientations and rearrange fields to achieve your specific results. The Recommended PivotTables feature was added in Excel 2013, so if you have an earlier version, follow the instructions below for how to manually create a PivotTable instead.</p><p>You can also download our interactive Make your first PivotTable tutorial.</p><p><strong>Recommended PivotTable</strong></p><p><strong>Manually create a PivotTable</strong></p><p>Click a cell in the source data or table range.</p><figure class="image"><img src="/content/images/73c2b585-9ccd-4f06-9026-26790637b390"></figure><p>Go to Insert &gt; Tables &gt; Recommended PivotTable.</p><figure class="image"><img src="/content/images/35c8fd6d-5abe-4b87-beea-17a2f4bbf6ac"></figure><p>Excel analyzes your data and presents you with several options, like in this example using the household expense data.</p><p>Select the PivotTable that looks best to you and press OK.

By default, non-numeric fields are added to the Row area, date and time fields are added to the Column area, and numeric fields are added to the Values area. You can also manually drag-and-drop any available item into any of the PivotTable fields, or if you no longer want an item in your PivotTable, simply drag it out of the Fields list or uncheck it.
